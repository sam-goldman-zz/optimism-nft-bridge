# L1ERC721Bridge



> L1ERC721Bridge



*The L1 ERC721 Bridge is a contract which stores deposited L1 NFTs that are in use on L2. It synchronizes a corresponding L2 Bridge, informing it of deposits and listening to it for newly finalized withdrawals.*

## Methods

### depositERC721

```solidity
function depositERC721(address _l1Token, address _l2Token, uint256 _tokenId, uint32 _l2Gas, bytes _data) external nonpayable
```



*deposit the ERC721 token to the caller on L2.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _l1Token | address | Address of the L1 ERC721 we are depositing
| _l2Token | address | Address of the L1 respective L2 ERC721
| _tokenId | uint256 | Token ID of the ERC721 to deposit
| _l2Gas | uint32 | Gas limit required to complete the deposit on L2.
| _data | bytes | Optional data to forward to L2. This data is provided        solely as a convenience for external contracts. Aside from enforcing a maximum        length, these contracts provide no guarantees about its content.

### depositERC721To

```solidity
function depositERC721To(address _l1Token, address _l2Token, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, uint32 _l2Gas, bytes _data) external nonpayable
```



*deposit the ERC721 token to a recipient on L2.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _l1Token | address | Address of the L1 ERC721 we are depositing
| _l2Token | address | Address of the L1 respective L2 ERC721
| _to | address | L2 address to credit the withdrawal to.
| _tokenId | uint256 | Token ID of the ERC721 to deposit.
| _l2Gas | uint32 | Gas limit required to complete the deposit on L2.
| _data | bytes | Optional data to forward to L2. This data is provided        solely as a convenience for external contracts. Aside from enforcing a maximum        length, these contracts provide no guarantees about its content.

### deposits

```solidity
function deposits(address, address, uint256) external view returns (bool)
```





#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined
| _1 | address | undefined
| _2 | uint256 | undefined

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined

### finalizeERC721Withdrawal

```solidity
function finalizeERC721Withdrawal(address _l1Token, address _l2Token, address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external nonpayable
```



*Complete a withdrawal from L2 to L1, and send the ERC721 token to the recipient on L1 This call will fail if the initialized withdrawal from L2 has not been finalized.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _l1Token | address | Address of L1 token to finalizeWithdrawal for.
| _l2Token | address | Address of L2 token where withdrawal was initiated.
| _from | address | L2 address initiating the transfer.
| _to | address | L1 address to credit the withdrawal to.
| _tokenId | uint256 | Token ID of the ERC721 to deposit.
| _data | bytes | Data provided by the sender on L2. This data is provided   solely as a convenience for external contracts. Aside from enforcing a maximum   length, these contracts provide no guarantees about its content.

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address _l1messenger, address _l2ERC721Bridge) external nonpayable
```





#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _l1messenger | address | L1 Messenger address being used for cross-chain communications.
| _l2ERC721Bridge | address | L2 ERC721 bridge address.

### l2ERC721Bridge

```solidity
function l2ERC721Bridge() external view returns (address)
```



*get the address of the corresponding L2 bridge contract.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | Address of the corresponding L2 bridge contract.

### messenger

```solidity
function messenger() external view returns (address)
```






#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined

### onERC721Received

```solidity
function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes data) external pure returns (bytes4)
```



*Whenever an {IERC721} `tokenId` token is transferred to this contract via {IERC721-safeTransferFrom} by `operator` from `from`, this function is called. It must return its Solidity selector to confirm the token transfer. If any other value is returned or the interface is not implemented by the recipient, the transfer will be reverted. The selector can be obtained in Solidity with `IERC721.onERC721Received.selector`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| operator | address | undefined
| from | address | undefined
| tokenId | uint256 | undefined
| data | bytes | undefined

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes4 | undefined
